      <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is a method of collaborative programming used by Dev Bootcamp, employers, and other programs to provide better and more reliable results. It employs each person taking on a role of either Driver or Navigator. Each has different responsibilities but both are active in the process.</p>

      <h2>Why is pair programming important to Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is important to Dev Bootcamp because not only is it a method that will be used in our jobs after the course is over, it also instills many of the philosophies that Dev Bootcamp believes in. Pair programming builds empathy between the individuals but it also prepares them for continuous pairing with other, different people with different backgrounds.</p>

  <!-- Add your reflection here.
I think it was really good for me to pair with Luis on this challenge. His comfort with the html and css (particularly the use of cascading selectors) was actually intimidating but once I got over that I ultimately realized I learned a lot from him. I definitely picked up some tricks (which I probably should have already known) such as creating selectors that use multiple elements to cover more ground.

It was also nice to review the importance of pair programming while pairing. It gave some nice context to the things that we were actively participating in.

I still don't feel super confident about my CSS skills. I'd like to improve in how I use selectors, classes, and IDs, and how I organize all of that.
