    <h1>Ugh... Net Neutrality. </h1>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Net Neutrality has become a highly politicized topic of conversation in the past year. Don't get me wrong... I think it is an incredibly important issue that will greatly affect the nation and the world moving forward. I just hate that it is being used in partisan politics. I don't typically like getting too political and I generally view myself as pretty moderate, but by the metrics established by the conversation of net neutrality in the media, I'm going to come across as a screaming liberal. I apologize if I offend anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Net neutrality is ultimately a very simple idea. The internet has been a bastion of even playing fields and freedom of expression (yes, despicable comment sections included) that has allowed companies like Kickstarter, Uber, or Grubhub to become the huge successes that they are today. Small companies can find huge success because they are so easily accessible to the public at large in the same way that huge companies have been able to establish. It's just as easy to go to Kickstarter's website as it is to go to Best Buy's website. Net neutrality ensures that this equal access remains intact by preventing internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, Verizon, or AT&T from slowing down or speeding up bandwidth to specified web services or from charging more or less for bandwidth to specified clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument that the free market should dictate pricing is good in theory but that assumes that the game is being played fairly. It assumes that competition is healthy (or even exists). There are very small portions of America where major ISPs compete for the same territory. They have essentially agreed to stay out of each other's backyard in order to maintain their own pricing structures and rules. That means that any price that is given to your or I for internet service or any price given to web services for the use of bandwidth is artificial and not a true market price.

          This directly affects us in Dev Bootcamp. Most of us will work for tech companies and many of these companies will be young. Regardless of how new or old a company is, it deserves to have equal access to its end users. Newer companies might struggle to meet bandwidth needs of its customer base because it can't pay to have the "fast lane" bandwidth of its established competitors. Or a booming company might be charged exorbitant rates for bandwidth because of how successful it is. Ultimately, the success or failure of a company is arbitrarily decided by the internet service provider.

          But to me the even bigger issue is not about business. It's about information dissemination. For our generation, information dissemination and the public conversation about it is done on the internet. We can't afford for the main forum of our conversation to be manipulated. I think it's easy to dismiss this issue as a wild conspiracy theory but imagine how wild our cable news networks are. It is not outlandish at all to imagine that the provider of the medium in its entirety would either manipulate what information is more accessible or force information sources to pay more to distribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact of the matter is that the internet has become so engrained to the western world's human condition that it is no longer a luxury. It is beginning to become as critical to the health of nations and their public dialogues as newspapers were.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why the FCC's decision to classify the internet providers as common carriers is right and so important. This basically puts them in the same category as water and power utilities. It means they can't throttle connections, or charge different prices for the same product. It means that everyone gets the same service. And that's the only way to keep the internet open and a true place of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>Obviously many people recoil when learning that net neutrality is just one more way that the government is getting involved in our daily lives. But in this instance, the government is getting involved for the purpose of maintaining openness and freedom. This sounds like something that would appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. The alternative is letting the rules be made by Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, and the like. Companies who aren't in true competition. Who aren't innovating. Who are threatening the freedom of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the FCC has voted to establish ISPs as common carriers, the fight isn't over. Inevitably congress will fight the decision. Most people don't understand what net neutrality really is. That's because it's been distilled into, as Ted Cruz tweeted after President Obama's statement about Net Neutrality last fall, "Obamacare for the internet." The conversation is turning it into something that liberals support and conservatives should fight against. This isn't OK. The biggest thing any of us can do about net neutrality is understand what it is and spread the word. Talk to people about it. Talk about how important it really is and how it is NOT a partisan issue. This is an American issue.
