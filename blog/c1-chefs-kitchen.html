  <h1>Initial Thoughts on Dev Bootcamp</h1>
  <h2>Excitement, Concern, and Overall Peace</h2>
  <h4>February 8, 2015</h4>

        I am really excited to be a part of Dev Bootcamp. The program seemingly embraces many of the same beliefs I hold while also challenging a lot of shortcomings I believe I possess.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking charge of my life is a fairly new concept to me. My struggles with ADD have often left me feeling unduly inadequate and as a product I have rarely felt capable of making the decisions in life that my peers have made. The past couple years, though, have forged something within that has readied me for my breaking point. The decision to apply to and enroll in Dev Bootcamp is my first step of taking control of my life. And it feels really awesome. This is why hearing Shereef discuss the Kitchen vs. Table mindset is both exciting and intimidating. It's all about taking control.

        It's definitely going to be a test to try to maintain a kitchen mindset. Similar to what Shereef described, I have had a history of being a subordinate to my teachers. I tend to not think of myself as a peer and I have to remind myself that an education requires teamwork. I want to learn how to revel and thrive in the creator mindset not only for my own benefit but for the benefit of my DBC teachers and my fellow students.

        Of the two basic fears discussed in the fireside discussion, the first resonates deeply with me. I absolutely experience impostor syndrome. Actually, I did exactly what he set as an example. When I received my acceptance email, after the initial jubilation, my first thought was, "This was a fluke. I tricked them," followed by something worse, "Maybe their standards are lower than I thought they were."

        The first week of DBC has been a rollercoaster. At first I was incredibly intimidated. Then my intro session helped ease many of my concerns. Then I hit some speedbumps in a couple of the early challenges, followed by figuring them out and flying high for a while. The best thing I've learned from the first week is that <b>I can do this</b>. I care about this and it turns out that makes a big ass difference. Despite not contributing a ton and also being slightly intimidated by the sheer volume of posts, the Google + community has been so supportive. Dev Bootcamp has done a wonderful job of selecting participants who embrace their philosphies. It feels so so good to be at school and feel safe and feel capable. I think I'm going to thrive in Phase 1-3. Phase 0 will be more challenging because I absolutely appreciate a submersive environment and working with people, but I've learned that <b>I can do this</b>.

    <p>
        There are going to be days when I shut down. When I feel like I'm going to fail. So far, the only remedy has been to keep going. I think it will always be the only remedy. I'm excited to learn I'm capable of GOING.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I keep coming back to peace. I have found some amount of peace in my life. Knowing that I have chosen to do something hard and that it feels like something I can do. It's something I can be proud of and I can already feel my confidence growing. Not only in my ability to be a student again but throughout my life. It's nice to take control. It's nice to be in the Kitchen.
