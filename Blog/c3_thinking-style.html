      <h1>Thinking Styles</h1>
      <p>
        I have had varying interest in personality tests like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Enneagram Personality System since I have learned about them. I think they are at once fascinating and frustrating. There is value in analyzing and interpretting parts of your personality and it can be comforting knowing that there are other people who may feel similarly to you. At the same time, I sometimes recoil at attempts to categorize people into neat bundles that we ascribe values and description to. This reaction to these tests may stem from the fact that I rarely come up as decidedly one category or type.  I think there is some discomfort not feeling like I know what I am on these tests so I end up feeling like I'm multiple people in one body when the fact of the matter is that everybody is multifaceted and can't be strictly defined as one type or another.
      </p>

        I had never heard of the Gregorc Mind Styles before. I was actually encouraged by its limited scope and the fact that it outright stated that these attributes (abstract, concrete, sequential, and random) are present in everyone but some are more accentuated than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are my results from the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Concrete Sequential</td>
            <td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Abstract Sequential</td>
            <td>24</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Abstract Random</td>
            <td>52</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Concrete Random</td>
            <td>40</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        And in first place is Abstract Random! I think that if I had to guess which I would score as before taking the quiz, I would have said Abstract Random.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the Abstract Random breakdown on <u><a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">this page</a></u>, these are the items that most resonated with me:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This Learner Likes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Bringing harmony to group situations</li>
              <li>Establishing healthy relationships with others</li>
            </ul>
          <li>They Learn Best When:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
              <li>Able to participate in group activities</li>
            </ul>
          <li>What's hard for them?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
              <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
              <li>Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive in group settings that are not restrictive and encourage harmony, and I like to use my intuition and imagination. Bouncing ideas off of a group or a partner is exciting to me and I often find I am most productive in these settings. Respect and acceptance are really important to me and I believe they are integral components of healthy relationships (both professional and personal). When I'm not given freedom and respect at work, I recognize that I sometimes overreact and become offended to the point where it's hard for me to focus on the task at hand. This is an aspect of the Abstract Random style I would like to learn how to control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inevitably, you will score lower in a style or two than the others, but the fact that my Concrete Sequential score is SO low makes me want to learn to develop those elements of myself. Even though I might feel very comfortable using my abstract and random abilities, there are going to be times when I would benefit from developed concrete and sequential abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phase 0 hasn't been easy for me. I have ADD, which either contributes to my abstract and random abilities or the other way around (chicken or the egg, right?), and I have had a VERY hard time staying as organized and as structured as Phase 0 requires us to be. If I could better exhibit the traits of the concrete and sequential abilities, I think I would be able to grow rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where adhering to a growth mindset will be especially important. Reading Carol Dweck's ideas on the fixed and growth mindsets has been an eye-opener. It dawned on me how frequently I exhibit a fixed mindset about ability and intelligence. I was actually really scared by it and was motivated to make changes. Simply reading about the mindsets and internalizing the ramifcations of the fixed mindset was enough to begin a transformation. I started feeling differently about challenges and criticism and it has allowed me to enjoy being frustrated by Dev Bootcamp! I think I first noticed a change when I was getting really fed up with CSS in week 2 and realized that I was having fun. It felt like a puzzle that I didn't want to put down.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm pretty confident that my Abstract Random tendencies will pay off when we finally get onsite in Phase 1. I took a tour of the office before I was accepted and I got the impression that the office was a really open and accepting space with good, collaborative energy. Not only will I benefit from that environment but I think I will contribute greatly to a positive experience for those around me! :)
